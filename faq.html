</ul>
<p><strong>Sponsorship prices:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    $1000 - The gift of time; this provides these events to have an additional
    hour on the water
  </li>
  <li>
    $1500 – The gift of gab; this gets a sponsor table with one attendee, for
    activity or birds-of-a-feather topic tables
  </li>
  <li>
    $100 – The gift of education; this buys a ticket for someone who otherwise
    can’t afford to attend

    Hackboat Unconferences
  </li>

<h3>What hours will the Hackboat be cruising?</h3>
<p>Time on the water should be from 10am to 2pm.</p>

<h3>Food and drinks?</h3>
<p>
  Lunch and appetizers are provided; there is a bar, but Hackboat attendees are
  required to pay for their own drinks.
</p>

<h3>Internet?</h3>
<p>There will be internet, but it will be boat internet.</p>

<h3>Is this an infinitely sized Hackboat?</h3>
<p>No, there is a limit of 140 people on this Hackboat.</p>

<h3>How much money are you making from this?</h3>
<p>
  Ticket costs are structured to just cover costs; sponsorship tiers allow us to
  put on future Hackboat unconferences and are tax deductible since this is a
  BSides event. No money is pocketed by anyone from this, and everything over
  the costs to put this on are put towards the next one (and other cool events).
