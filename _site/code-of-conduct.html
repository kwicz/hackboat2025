    <h1>Hackboat Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p class="important">
      We have NO TOLERANCE for physical/verbal/sexual harassment.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage everyone to be a part of creating a supportive community
      where anyone can feel comfortable, have fun, learn, and exchange ideas
      about Security. Hackboat supports an environment where ideas can be freely
      expressed and challenged in a way that is also free of harassment of any
      sort.
